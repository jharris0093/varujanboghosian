Given the broad range of themes represented in Boghosian’s work, when the collection was processed, it was organized into series according to subject matter. Explore the complete collection or select a series of works from below for a more refined search. Unless indicated otherwise, all art on display is owned by the estate of Varujan Boghosian. To inquire about any of the pieces, please contact the executor of the estate and the artist’s daughter, Heidi Boghosian, at heidiboghosian@gmail.com.
